-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testKIsZero
        Description: This test verifies the top 0 elements are returned for k = 0 (i.e., the output
            is a list of size 0).

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testKIsNegative
        Description: This test verifies that the correct exception is thrown for negative values of
            k.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testKEqualsN
        Description: This test verifies the corrected sorted sequence is returned for a random list
            of size ~100 and k = that size.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testNonIntegerEntries
        Description: This test verifies a List<String> as the input will return the correct
            topKSort, for small k and list size.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testKIs1
        Description: This test verifies the correct sorted sequence is returned for k of 1 and a
            reasonably large n.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testNIs1
        Description: This test verifies the correct sorted sequence is returned for n of 1 and a
            small k.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testKIsGreaterThanN
        Description: This test verifies the correct sorted sequence is returned for a random list of
            size ~100 and k is larger.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testInputListNotMutated
        Description: This test verifies the input object is not mutated (modified) - see the
            documentation for topKSort on mutation.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testKIsLessThanN
        Description: This test verifies the corrected sorted sequence is returned for a random list
            of size ~100 and k < 10.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testAlreadySortedInput
        Description: This test verifies a corrected sorted sequence as input is still sorted and
            returned properly.

-   FAIL: (weight=4.0) testIsNLogK
        Description: This test is on the runners; it checks whether the runtime of topKSort is in
            O(n*log(k)) by counting comparison operations.
        java.lang.AssertionError: Too many comparison to be in O(n * log(k))

## ArrayHeap

Score: 15 / 15

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testInsertNullEntriesThrowsException
        Description: This test verifies that the correct exception is throw when null values are
            inserted into your heap.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testRandomEntries
        Description: This test adds random values to the heap a random number of times. It then
            empties the heap and verifies that peekMin and removeMin work over the whole heap and
            return the expected sorted sequence. This is done for 1000 trials.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testSimpleUsage
        Description: This is a "average case" test that relies on insertions, removeMins and size
            operations.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testPeekOnEmptyQueueThrowsException
        Description: Calling peekMin on an empty ArrayHeap should throw an EmptyContainerException -
            if this test fails, that was not the case for your code. This test also inserts and
            removes before testing the EmptyContainerException case.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testPeekMin
        Description: This tests both that peekMin returns the minimum and that subsequently calling
            removeMin gives you the same value.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testInsertDuplicateEntries
        Description: This test inserts the same few unique elements ~10,000 times. Then it verifies
            that peekMin and removeMin work over the whole heap will return the expected sorted
            sequence.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testInternalStructure
        Description: This method inserts many random elements (order of magnitude 10,000). Then it
            loops less-than-the-size number of times and randomly chooses to insert or removeMin
            each loop iteration. After, we use reflection to verify that internal array correctly
            represents a min-4-heap, where each value is smaller than or equal to its (at most) 4
            children.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testInsertMany
        Description: This test inserts many integer elements (order of magnitude is in the
            thousands), and verifies the many calls to removeMin return a sequence that is
            increasing in value. It removes every element from the heap in the end. Additionally,
            all the values are unique.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testStringEntries
        Description: This test inserts a handful (3 levels) of String elements and checks that
            peekMin then removeMin over the whole heap will return the expected sorted sequence.

-   PASS: (weight=1.0) testRemoveMinOnEmptyQueueThrowsException
        Description: Calling removeMin on an empty ArrayHeap should throw an EmptyContainerException
            - if this test fails, that was not the case for your code. This test also inserts and
            removes before testing the EmptyContainerException case.
