1.a) My name is Sanjeev Janarthanan and I worked alone.

  b) I thought the project overall was pretty engaging and helped me learn more about linked lists and trees. I enjoyed having
     to figure out the implementation for the DoubleLinkedList. I didn't enjoy coding the AST as much because I thought it was 
     less engaging.
 
  c) It would be helpful to add a note for how to access the children in the handleSimplify method of the ExpressionManipulators class.
     I wasted a lot of time trying to figure this out.
